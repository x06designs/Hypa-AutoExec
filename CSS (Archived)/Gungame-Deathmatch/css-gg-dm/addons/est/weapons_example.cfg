// Weapon Mods!!!
// Default action of weapons can be achived by making all damages "0" and changing damageaction to 1, or by removing the weapon block all together
// recoil determines how much the person who shot the gun gets pushed away from the shot
// punchback determines how much to push anyone shot by the bullets away

// HitGroup damages
// GENERIC	0
// HEAD		1
// CHEST	2
// STOMACH	3
// LEFTARM	4
// RIGHTARM	5
// LEFTLEG	6
// RIGHTLEG	7

// Keep in mind, some weapons only do certain types of damage, (knives and grenades only do GENERIC - damage0).

// a Damageaction of = will make the specified damage OVERWRITE the dealt damage0
// a Damageaction of + will ADD the specified damage to the specified weapon damage0
// a Damageaction of * will MULTIPLY the dealt damage by the specified weapon damage0

// Special note, shotguns (the m3 and xm1014) have MULTIPLE bullets,
// this means you have a possiblity of 7/8 bullets each shot, this can add up here very quickly)
